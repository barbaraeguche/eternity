# eternity calculator ✖️
eternity is a scientific calculator designed to compute various transcendental functions, integrating principles of design thinking, agile methodologies, and devops. 

## features 👾
- **minimalistic ui**: a clean and intuitive interface that reduces distractions, allowing users to focus on their calculations effortlessly.
- **transcendental buttons**: access advanced functions like `arccos(x)`, `sinh(x)`, `standard deviation`, and more for complex mathematical operations beyond basic arithmetic.
- **digit buttons**: easy-to-use buttons for numbers `0 - 9`, along with `+/-` for sign changes, `.` for decimal input, and a `,` (comma) for calculating complex mathematical operations that require multiple inputs.
- **operator buttons**: essential buttons for arithmetic operations `(+, -, x, /, %)` and functions like `sqrt` (square root), `1/x`, and a `=` to display calculated values.
- **special buttons**: features like `c` (clear), `ce` (clear entry), and `back` (delete last input) to help manage calculations efficiently.
- **radio buttons**: options to switch between degree and radian modes for trigonometric calculations, ensuring flexibility in usage.

## the process ✍🏽

## how to use ❓
- **Logarithmic functions**: If you want to use log with base 10, you would put in the number, using the digit buttons `0 - 9`, you want as an argument and then click `log_b(x)` to get the result. If you want euler (e) as your base, put in the number into the display using the digit buttons `0 - 9` and click `ln(x)` for the result. If you want to use a different base than 10 or euler (e), you put in what you calculate using buttons `0 - 9`, then a `,` (comma) to seperate the arguments, followed by your number using digit buttons `0 - 9` for the base. It should look like x,b in the display. x being the argument to calculate logarithm and b being the base of the logarithm.

- **ArcCos function**: 
1. **Switch to Radian or Degree Mode**:  
   Depending on your calculation, make sure the calculator is set to radians or degrees. You can usually toggle this in the settings.

2. **Locate the Arccos Button**:  
   This is often labeled as `cos⁻¹` or may be a secondary function of the cosine button. You may need to press a `SHIFT` or `2ND` button before pressing `cos` to access it.

3. **Input the Value**:  
   Enter the value whose arccosine you want to find. The value must be between -1 and 1, as the arccos function is only defined within this range.

4. **Press Enter/Equals**:  
   The calculator will return the angle whose cosine is equal to the input value.

**Example**:  
To find `arccos(0.5)` in degrees:
```
SHIFT + cos → 0.5 → =
```
Result: 60° (if in degree mode), 1.0472 (if in radian mode).
